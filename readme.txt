REPORT

11.09.2015
Opened git repository and uploaded all the relevant code until today's lab meeting. The code is a bit messy at the moment because I borrowed heavily from psychtoolbox tutorials, sorry about that.

18.09.2015
Code for the phase one is almost finished. Minor problems have to be fixed about keyboard input.

12.10.2015
Memory overflow problem persisting, partly due to the blending. Keyboard input is fixed but needs to be disabled after getting one input for a trial.


For phase one, use: phase_one.m
- Same, but without fancy alphablending: without_blending.m
- Results are currently collected in a csv file called "trial.csv"


Other things to do before experiment goes on air:
- Encode subject initials and date/time to avoid mixing data
